AWS Cloud – VPC + Linux Server Notes
📌 1️⃣ AWS VPC Basics

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
A logically isolated network in AWS where you can launch cloud resources.

CIDR Block:
Defines IP range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)

Subnets:
Divide VPC into smaller networks

Public Subnet: Internet access allowed

Private Subnet: Isolated from the internet

Internet Gateway (IGW):
A gateway that connects VPC to the internet

📌 2️⃣ Create a Custom VPC
Setting	Value
VPC Name	My-VPC
IPv4 CIDR	10.0.0.0/16
📌 3️⃣ Create Subnets in VPC
Subnet	CIDR	Public IP	Purpose
Public Subnet	10.0.1.0/24	Enabled ✅	Web/SSH access
Private Subnet	10.0.2.0/24	Disabled ❌	Databases/Backend

✔ Public subnet routes to internet
❌ Private subnet has no direct internet

📌 4️⃣ Internet Connectivity

Steps:

Create Internet Gateway → Attach to VPC

Create Public Route Table

Add route:

0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway


Associate with Public Subnet

Private Route Table:

No Internet Gateway route

📌 5️⃣ Security Concepts

Security Groups

Virtual firewall for EC2 instances

Controls inbound & outbound traffic

Example rules:

Type	Port	Source	Purpose
SSH	22	My IP	Connect to server
HTTP	80	Anywhere	Websites

NACLs (Network ACLs)

Subnet-level firewall

Stateless

🖥️ Launch Linux Server in Public Subnet
📌 Steps:

Go to EC2 → Launch Instance

Select Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu AMI

Instance Type: t2.micro (Free-Tier)

Network settings:

VPC: My-VPC

Subnet: public-subnet

Auto-assign Public IP: ✅ Enabled

Security Group:

Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP

Create & download key pair

Launch instance 🎉

📌 Connect to Linux Server (SSH)

From your Linux / Mac terminal:

ssh -i "mykey.pem" ec2-user@<Public-IP>


For Ubuntu AMI:

ssh -i "mykey.pem" ubuntu@<Public-IP>


If using Windows, connect using:
✅ Git Bash
✅ PuTTY
✅ Windows Terminal (SSH support)

🔍 Verify Public vs Private Access
Instance Location	Expected Result
Public Subnet	✅ Ping internet / update packages
Private Subnet	❌ No internet (without NAT gateway)

Test command:

ping google.com

🧠 Key Takeaways
Component	Purpose
VPC	Your private cloud network
Public Subnet	Hosts publicly accessible resources
Private Subnet	Secure, internal services
Internet Gateway	Public Internet access
Security Group	Instance-level traffic protection
Route Tables	Define network routing rules
